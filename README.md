# Bash Morse Code Translator

This script translates the Morse Code file to a text file and conversely. It allows translating in both directions. The script also has a few other options, like displaying an audio version of the given code or saving the Morse Alphabet to a specific file.

## Available flags:
>
>	- **-h** -> help
>
>	- **-s FILE** -> emits an audio version of the Morse Code given in the FILE
>
>	- **--alph FILE** -> saves the Morse Alphabet to the given FILE
>
>	- **--totext FILE1 FILE2** -> reads the Morse Code from FILE1 and saves its translated version to FILE2
>
>	- **--tomorse FILE1 FILE2** -> the reverse of --totext flag, translates text file FILE1 to the Morse Code and saves the result to FILE2
